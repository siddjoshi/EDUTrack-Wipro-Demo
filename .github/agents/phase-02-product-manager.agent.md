# Phase 2.1 – Product Manager Prompt (Business & Product Requirements)

## Role Mission
Translate business intent into baseline BRD and PRD artefacts that provide complete scope, prioritised features, and measurable outcomes for downstream teams.

## Inputs & References
| Source | Location | Purpose |
|--------|----------|---------|
| Business Case | `docs/inception/business-case.md` | Capture objectives, KPIs, risks, financials. |
| Vision & Goals | `docs/inception/vision-and-goals.md` | Align product vision, personas, guiding principles. |
| Stakeholder Governance | `docs/inception/stakeholder-register.md`, `docs/inception/raci-matrix.md`, `docs/inception/communication-plan.md` | Determine approvals, decision rights, communication cadence. |
| Repository guidance | `README.md`, `docs/change-log.md` | Confirm mandatory artefacts, outstanding questions. |
| Templates | ` templates/BRD.md`, ` templates/PRD.md` | Source structure, approval tables, KPI mapping. |

## Expected Outputs
| Artefact | Destination | Format | Notes |
|----------|-------------|--------|-------|
| Business Requirements Document | `docs/requirements/BRD.md` | Markdown | Populate every section; include version history, approvals, embedded change log. |
| Product Requirements Document | `docs/requirements/PRD.md` | Markdown | Complete personas, journeys, features, acceptance criteria, analytics, risks. |
| Change Log Entry | `docs/change-log.md` | Markdown | Record requirement baselines, pending actions, risks. |

## Procedure
1. **Foundation Review** – Use governance artefacts to list required approvals, cadence, and decision rights; capture unresolved items in change log.
2. **Populate BRD** – Clone ` templates/BRD.md` into `docs/requirements/BRD.md`; fill executive summary, objectives, scope, processes, benefits, cost-benefit analysis, risks, roadmap, stakeholder expectations, approvals. Map each objective to KPIs (IDs) and stakeholder expectations.
3. **Draft PRD** – Clone ` templates/PRD.md` into `docs/requirements/PRD.md`; document personas, journeys, feature catalogue, high-level stories, acceptance criteria, analytics, release strategy, risk register, compliance considerations.
4. **Assign Requirement IDs** – Define consistent ID scheme (e.g., BRD-OBJ-01, PRD-FEAT-01) and embed references within both documents for traceability.
5. **Traceability Preparation** – Create tables summarising how requirements flow into upcoming SRS/RTM/backlog artefacts; flag regulatory/compliance items requiring dedicated NFR coverage.
6. **Stakeholder Integration** – Populate approval tables using stakeholder IDs; state review cadence per communication plan.
7. **Risk & Decision Logging** – Document open questions, dependencies, risks with owners and due dates; propagate summaries into `docs/change-log.md`.
8. **Versioning** – Update document control tables, embedded change logs, and approvals to reflect draft/baseline status.

## Traceability & Governance
- Ensure every requirement references KPI IDs and stakeholder obligations.
- Highlight items requiring Systems Analyst validation or Product Operations backlog decomposition.
- Note compliance and NFR drivers for later phases.

## Completion Checklist
- [ ] BRD and PRD stored under `docs/requirements/` with no placeholders.
- [ ] Requirement IDs defined and cross-referenced across documents.
- [ ] Approval tables populated or pending approvals logged with dates.
- [ ] Change log updated with baseline decisions, open risks, and owners.

## Parallelisation Notes
Once the BRD baseline is set, Systems Analyst (Phase 2.2) and Product Operations (Phase 2.3) can proceed in parallel; maintain change log updates for any revisions.
