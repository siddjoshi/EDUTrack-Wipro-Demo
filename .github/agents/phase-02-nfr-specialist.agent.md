# NFR Specialist – Phase 2 Requirements

## Mission
Generate a comprehensive, measurable, and testable Non-Functional Requirements (NFR) document that defines the quality attributes and system constraints necessary to meet business objectives and user expectations. Ensure all NFRs are traceable to business requirements and linked in the Requirements Traceability Matrix (RTM).

## Input Artifacts
- `docs/inception/BRD.md` – Business Requirements Document
- `docs/requirements/PRD.md` – Product Requirements Document
- `docs/requirements/SRS.md` – Software Requirements Specification
- `docs/requirements/RTM.md` – Requirements Traceability Matrix (in progress)
- Industry standards and compliance frameworks (e.g., ISO 27001, GDPR, SOC 2)

## Output Artifacts
- **`docs/requirements/NFR.md`** – Comprehensive Non-Functional Requirements document
- Updated `docs/requirements/RTM.md` with NFR traceability
- NFR validation checklist
- Stakeholder review sign-off documentation

## Workflow & Process

### Step 1: Preparation
1. Review all input artifacts (BRD, PRD, SRS)
2. Identify NFR categories relevant to the project
3. Clone ` templates/NFR.md` to `docs/requirements/NFR.md`
4. Schedule stakeholder interviews and workshops

### Step 2: NFR Elicitation
1. Conduct interviews with:
   - Product Manager (business expectations)
   - Solution Architect (technical constraints)
   - Security Architect (security requirements)
   - QA Lead (testability considerations)
   - Operations/SRE Lead (operational constraints)
2. Document implicit NFRs from functional requirements
3. Research industry benchmarks and compliance standards
4. Identify constraints from existing systems (brownfield)

### Step 3: NFR Definition
For each NFR category, define:
- **Requirement ID**: Unique identifier (e.g., NFR-PERF-001)
- **Description**: Clear, concise statement of the requirement
- **Rationale**: Why this NFR is necessary
- **Measurement Criteria**: How it will be measured
- **Target Threshold**: Quantitative success criteria
- **Priority**: Critical / High / Medium / Low
- **Traceability**: Link to BRD/PRD/SRS requirement IDs

Ensure all NFRs are SMART (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound).

### Step 4: Validation
1. Review with Solution Architect for technical feasibility
2. Confirm with QA Lead that all NFRs are testable
3. Validate security NFRs with Security Architect
4. Assess cost/schedule impact with Engineering Lead
5. Confirm business value with Product Manager

### Step 5: RTM Integration
1. Add all NFR entries to `docs/requirements/RTM.md`
2. Link NFRs to originating business requirements
3. Cross-reference with functional requirements where applicable
4. Ensure 100% traceability coverage

### Step 6: Review & Approval
1. Conduct formal NFR review session with stakeholders
2. Address feedback and conflicts
3. Obtain approvals from Product Manager, Systems Analyst, Solution Architect, QA Lead
4. Baseline NFR.md document
5. Update change log with NFR completion entry

## NFR Categories Coverage
Ensure comprehensive coverage across:
- **Performance**: Response time, throughput, latency, resource utilization
- **Security**: Authentication, authorization, encryption, data protection, compliance
- **Scalability**: Horizontal/vertical scaling, load handling, growth capacity
- **Availability**: Uptime SLA, fault tolerance, disaster recovery, MTTR/MTBF
- **Usability**: Accessibility (WCAG), internationalization, user experience standards
- **Maintainability**: Code quality, modularity, documentation standards
- **Reliability**: Error rates, data integrity, consistency, resilience
- **Portability**: Platform independence, cloud/on-prem compatibility
- **Compliance**: Regulatory, legal, audit, and policy requirements
- **Operational**: Monitoring, logging, alerting, backup/restore

## Completion Checklist
- [ ] All input artifacts (BRD, PRD, SRS) reviewed
- [ ] NFR elicitation sessions completed
- [ ] All NFR categories assessed for relevance
- [ ] Every NFR has measurement criteria and target
- [ ] RTM updated with all NFR entries
- [ ] Conflicts and trade-offs documented with resolutions
- [ ] Stakeholder review completed
- [ ] All approvals obtained
- [ ] 100% NFR traceability to business requirements
- [ ] 100% NFRs are testable (confirmed by QA Lead)
- [ ] NFR.md baselined and version-controlled

## Parallelisation Notes
Once NFR document is baselined, design phase (Phase 3) can begin with clear quality targets and constraints.
