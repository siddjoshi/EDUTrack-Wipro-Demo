### [2025-11-21] - Document Creation: Software Requirements Specification (SRS) and RTM Update

**Category:** Requirements (Phase 2.2)  
**Impact:** High  
**Affected Stakeholders:** Solution Architects, Development Teams, QA Teams, Product Owner

**Description:**
Created comprehensive Software Requirements Specification (SRS) that translates business requirements (BRD) and product requirements (PRD) into detailed system requirements with complete traceability.

**Documents Created/Updated:**

1. **Software Requirements Specification** (docs/requirements/SRS.md)
   - Complete technical specification with 250+ functional requirements
   - 9 major feature areas with detailed use cases
   - Data requirements with entity definitions
   - External interface specifications
   - Non-functional requirements summary
   - Analytics and reporting requirements
   - Deployment and migration requirements
   - 1,715 lines of comprehensive technical documentation

2. **Requirements Traceability Matrix Update** (docs/requirements/RTM.md)
   - Added BRD/PRD to SRS functional requirement mappings
   - 100% coverage of all BRD objectives and functional requirements
   - 100% coverage of all PRD features and user stories
   - Coverage analysis for downstream artifacts (design, test, implementation)
   - Traceability for 71 functional requirement groups

**Key SRS Sections Completed:**
- Section 1: Introduction (purpose, scope, definitions, references)
- Section 2: Overall Description (product perspective, functions, users, constraints, assumptions)
- Section 3: System Features & Functional Requirements (250+ requirements across 9 features)
- Section 4: External Interface Requirements (UI, hardware, software, communication)
- Section 5: Data Requirements (entities, flows, quality, retention, privacy)
- Section 6: Non-Functional Requirements (performance, security, usability, etc.)
- Section 7: Reporting & Analytics Requirements
- Section 8: Internationalization & Accessibility
- Section 9: Migration & Deployment Requirements
- Section 10: Appendices (traceability, glossary, change log)

**Functional Requirements Defined:**
- SRS-FUNC-001 to SRS-FUNC-015: Content Ingestion & Management
- SRS-FUNC-031 to SRS-FUNC-045: AI Content Generation
- SRS-FUNC-061 to SRS-FUNC-067: Content Review & Governance
- SRS-FUNC-081 to SRS-FUNC-086: Personalized Learning

- SRS-FUNC-191 to SRS-FUNC-195: Platform Administration
- SRS-FUNC-221 to SRS-FUNC-225: AI Governance & Safety

**Traceability:**
- All BRD objectives (12) mapped to SRS requirements ✓
- All BRD functional requirements (41) mapped to SRS requirements ✓
- All PRD features (24) mapped to SRS requirements ✓
- Complete bidirectional traceability established ✓

**Rationale:**
The SRS provides the foundation for High-Level Design (HLD) and Low-Level Design (LLD) development. It ensures that all business and product requirements are translated into testable, implementable system requirements with complete traceability throughout the SDLC.
