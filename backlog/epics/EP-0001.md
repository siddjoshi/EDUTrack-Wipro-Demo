## 2. Executive Summary
- **Problem / Opportunity Statement:** The organization's learning and development operations cannot meet the rapidly evolving skill requirements of 10,000 employees. Manual content creation takes 40-60 hours per module, creating a 200+ request backlog. Training content is fragmented across SharePoint, Confluence, and local drives with no centralized discovery. Employees spend 15 minutes on average searching for relevant training, and 82% compliance training completion creates regulatory risk.

- **Desired Outcome:** Transform EDUTrack into an AI-powered platform that automates training content generation, delivers personalized learning experiences, and provides comprehensive analytics. Reduce content creation time from 50 hours to <15 hours per module, increase output from 60 to 120+ modules annually, enable content discovery in <2 minutes, and achieve 98% compliance training completion.

- **Strategic Alignment:** Directly supports corporate FY2025-2027 strategic priorities:
  - Digital Transformation: Accelerate AI/ML skills across workforce by 40%
  - Operational Excellence: 70% reduction in training costs ($450 → $135 per employee annually)
  - Employee Experience: Improve engagement scores by 15%, reduce voluntary turnover by 5%
  - Innovation Leadership: Demonstrate responsible AI governance and build reusable capabilities

- **Business Value Hypothesis:** $7.81M quantified benefits over 3 years with 285% ROI and 14-month payback. Benefits include: $1.54M in content creation cost savings, $2.4M in productivity gains from faster skill acquisition, $900K in compliance risk mitigation, and $1.8M in retention improvement.
